I am a certified [Software Carpentries](https://carpentries.org/instructors/) instructor.

All my teaching materials are freely and publicly available. We created a bookdown [textbook](https://educe-ubc.github.io/workshops/) to accompany the [ECOSCOPE](http://ecoscope.ubc.ca/) workshops. As well, we created [educer](https://github.com/EDUCE-UBC/educer), a R package to accompany the workshops.
