Hello! My name is Andrew Li and I am psychology master's student at the University of British Columbia, where I am supervised by [Jiaying Zhao](https://psych.ubc.ca/profile/jiaying-zhao/).

My research focuses on applying psychological principles and insights to address environmental issues. Towards this end, I run field and lab experiments to promote behavior change in waste reduction and climate mitigation.
